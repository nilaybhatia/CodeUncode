MegaHard Teams is a famous software in Chefland for conducting online meetings and lectures. 
As a Software Engineer on the team, you are tasked with implementing a new feature.

In its current implementation, when the internet connection temporarily disappears, the data packets can't reach the students
attending the lectures in real time. Instead, the data packets sent from the professor's side are temporarily buffered and as soon as the connection
is restored, they are sent immediately. That is why you can sometimes hear your prof speak too fast after an unstable internet connection, while in reality
they are the buffered packets arriving late.

You are given an array a with the size of the data packets that leave the prof's computer every microsecond.
